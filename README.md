# Political-Alignment-and-Premarital-Sex
# IS IT WRONG FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO ENGAGE IN PREMARITAL SEX? 

In this project, I analyse public opinion by exploring the relationship between political alignment groups among Americans and their beliefs about having premarital sex,
using data on the premarsx variable from the General Social Survey (GSS) over almost five decades between 1972 and 2018. The total number of respondents who responded to
this question was 62466. I obtained the responses over time, with the values of each row range between 0 and 1 and displayed the results in a linear graph form.
To establish the relationship between political alignment and the premarsx variable, I recoded political alignment into three groups: conservatives, moderates and liberals.

# ANALYSIS
Kindly go through the colab notebook
Also read the word document for my project blog.

# FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING
From the analysis, it is surprising to realise that more conservatives are beginning to think that having premarital sex is not wrong at all over the past few decades.
The fraction of “yes” responses from conservatives is currently about 0.5, while liberals constituted about 0.52 in the early 1970s. Currently,
conservatives are nearly as liberal as liberals were in the early 1970s.
